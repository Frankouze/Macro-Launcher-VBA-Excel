Hello and welcome to my repository, 

This page has currently 4 Excel sheets that you can download, and that offers free and ready-made automation involving Microsoft software (Excel & Word documents), PDFs and a multiple document renaming function. 
The title of each document is an indication of what the automation allows you to do. 
Inside each document, you will find explanations on how to fit the automation to your needs before launching the process. 

I am relatively new to Github, therefore if you have any recommendations on how to improve my repository, I would be more than happy to get your feedback. 
The existing code is open for improvements. Furthermore, feel free to apply this idea of Macro Launchers to other processes you can think of. In that case, don't forget to publish them alongside :)

Sincerely yours, 
Frankouze
